Zoe & IZAAK CONQUER THE WORLD

Algo:
Min priority queue
Log n
Add, remove
data will be of time [Event(time), PWC(time), PPC(time)]

remove item with lowest time is valid and not w



1. Define collisions and ticks
	- done ticks

	



2. Particle Simulation
	2a. Predict all collisions
		- Find unsorted event list given state of the world
			- append ticks to end of array
	2b. Move events into tree (tree will need to have ability to add and remove)
	2c. Implement happen
		- Take event from queue
		- Apply react_to to particle  
	2d. Visualize
		- update display


aux: create tree data structure


3. Minimum priority queue
	3a. Remove invalid events
	3b. Remove null events
	3c. Sort in time
